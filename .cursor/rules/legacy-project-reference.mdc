# Legacy Project Reference

The `legacy-project` folder in the project root contains the legacy MVP project (vcmanda) that serves as the reference implementation for this project.

## Key Points:
- **Location**: `./legacy-project/` (project root)
- **Purpose**: Reference for behavior, and feature logic
- **When to Use**: When user mentions "legacy project" or asks to check how something was implemented in the legacy MVP
- **Exclusions**: The folder is excluded from:
  - TypeScript compilation (tsconfig.json, tsconfig.build.json)
  - ESLint linting (eslint.config.js)
  - Git tracking (.gitignore)

## Usage Pattern:
When implementing features or debugging issues, refer to the legacy project to understand:
- How features were originally implemented
- Expected behavior
- You should follow same feature objective and flow, the patterns in the legacy project are old and should be refactored to the DDD architecture.
- Integration approaches
- Cron job scheduling patterns
- OBS WebSocket usage patterns
- Media scheduling strategies

Always adapt legacy code to current project standards (DDD, NestJS, TypeScript) rather than copying directly.
DO NOT link the legacy project code into the new project.
DO NOT import anything from the legacy project.
