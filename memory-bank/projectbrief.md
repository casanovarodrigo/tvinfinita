# Project Brief: TV Infinita

## Overview
TV Infinita is a NestJS-based media catalog management system designed to discover, organize, and stage media content (TV shows and movies) for broadcasting/streaming purposes. The system integrates with OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) for media staging and playback control.

## Core Goals
1. **Media Discovery**: Automatically scan and catalog media files from local storage
2. **Media Organization**: Create structured playlists with episodes/seasons for TV shows
3. **Media Staging**: Integrate with OBS for broadcasting/streaming workflows
4. **Media Cataloging**: Track metadata (duration, resolution, format) for media files

## Key Requirements
- Support for TV shows and movies
- Automatic file discovery and metadata extraction
- Playlist management with ordering and collections
- OBS integration for media staging
- PostgreSQL database for persistence
- Domain-Driven Design architecture

## Project Scope
- Backend API only (NestJS)
- TypeScript throughout
- DDD principles with clear domain boundaries
- Result pattern for error handling
- Value objects for domain validation
